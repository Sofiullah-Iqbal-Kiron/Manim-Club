We know that the basic trigonometric series is
this equation appearing on the screen.
This equation will be called "Fourier Series" if the terms A nought, A N, B N could be substituted as
these equations.
Where F of x is any single valued function defined in the exclusive interval from minus PI to PI.
Thank You.
